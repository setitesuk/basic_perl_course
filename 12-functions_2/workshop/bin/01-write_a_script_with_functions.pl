use Modern::Perl;

# create a script (using functions) to create a file which, given a file of sequences and a file of amino acids,
# lists the amino acids next to the sequence

# i.e. ACGTAGCT.. Ala Stp..

# source files:

# data/amino_acid_codes.txt
# data/sequences.txt

# output file:

# output/sequences_with_codons_present.txt

# write functions which

# construct the amino acid data into a data structure that can be looped over (you will want a multi-dimensional structure)
# anything else you feel would be suitable to go in a function

# Note, you can utilise anything we have previously written, but see if you can extend further

# Bonus points if you can make >60% of the code into functions
