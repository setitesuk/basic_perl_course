### From now on in, we are going to use Sequence manipulation as our project, and move through from a procedural script (which we have been doing), to a script using self-written functions (the next section), to taking those functions and making them reusable between scripts via modules, and then onto objects.

We have now been using functions and data to do things, now lets try to be a bit cleverer and write a function ourselves.

# syntax for using a function

We have seen the following function calls

if ( $true ) {
  ...do something
}

print 'true' if $true;

say 'Hello World';

my $data = read_file( 'data_file' );

Whilst they all look different, the perl interpreter knows how to utilise the way functions work to decide how to operate.

1) Parameters are always a list (array) of items after the function name

  if ( $true )              # the braces indicate the lit of items to pass to if
  if $true                  # there is a single item, but this is passed to if as the first item of a list
  print 'true'              # we pass a single string as the first item of a list to print
  say 'Hello World'         # we pass a single string as the first item of a list to say
  read_file( 'data_file' )  # we pass a list of items, containing 'data_file' to read_file

What we know from this that functions require a list of parameters.

2) Functions always return

This may seem obvious, but we need the code to return back to the caller, in order to proceed

3) Perl/we checks the return value

We can capture a return value

my $data = read_file( 'data_file' );

In this case the return value is the content of 'data_file'

We can do something if it is true

print 'true' if $true;

If the return value of the call to if is true, then we will print

if ( $true ) {
  ...do something
}

If the return value of the call to if is true, then we will activate the block of code

We can ignore the return value

say 'Hello World';


Our simplest explanation of a function call can be summed up as

return_value = function ( list_of_parameters );

noting that return_value can be a scalar, an array, undef

With that in mind, lets create a function which takes some parameters, and returns something;
