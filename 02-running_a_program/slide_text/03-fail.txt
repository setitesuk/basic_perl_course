Sometimes scripts fail.

Perl is generally quite helpful when you have made a mistake in your script. It will try
to tell you where your problem occured, and what might have caused it.

If we try running the fail_world script:

>bin/fail_world.pl
Illegal division by zero at bin/fail_world.pl line 4.

This has been very helpful, we know at what line there is an error, and what the error is.

Sometimes a little bit of investigation is necessary, but generally, read the error, look at
the line, and see what it says.
