We have already used 2 functions when we ran our first programs:

  print 'Hello World!';
  say 'Hello World!';

Functions do what they say, they do something to perform an action.

Real world example of a function.

  Dialling a telephone number.

  dial '01234 123456';

This causes the phone to send out a message, which will ring a phone with the number 01234 123456

There are many functions inbuilt in perl (which are often called keywords). In our first programs, print and say are examples of these.

Also we can get additional functions, either from downloaded libraries which we import into our code, or that we can write ourselves. We'll look at these later.

Optionally, they sometimes also get called methods or subroutines, but there tends to be a context to that which we won't go into here. You can safely assume at the moment that should I mention keyword/function/method/subroutine, I am talking about one and the same thing.
