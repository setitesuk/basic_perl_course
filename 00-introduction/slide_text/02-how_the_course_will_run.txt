How the course will run?

The course is split into sections, in what I hope is a logical order. The first few sections won't have so many 'workshops' but I will encourage you to look at the code, and run the scripts to see what they are doing.

Where appropriate, we will concentrate on DNA sequences and Amino Acids as our subject matter, so that hopefully you can see relevance to your positions

Slide 11

You'll notice there aren't many workshops up front, and those that are could be scary (Objects seem to scare a lot of experienced programmers, let alone those new to it). The hope is that you will be building on the basics in the later workshops by using them, and that most workshops will build on previous ones. The thing to remember is that they are not about getting things right or wrong, but building the principles. There are my answers (not necessarily perfect) for each, with all the building blocks you need to attempt them. We will also go through each of them, so that you can understand where you may have got stuck.


Please ask as many questions as you need - during presenting or workshop sessions, but please make them relevant to learning perl, not how it might relate to other languages. If you know Java or Ruby, that is fantastic, and I'd probably question what you might get out of this course, but remember that others don't. The same also goes for systems. I am not here to answer your questions about the systems perl runs on. This might sound draconian, but I want everyone to hopefully come out of this class at the level of perl programmer, and you might hold up others by questioning like this.

Slide 12

The days will run from 9.30am -> 5pm sharp, with 45 minutes for lunch. We will break for coffee at suitable times, but this may be during a workshop, when I hope you will be able to go out, have a break and come back in with the workshop going on around you.

Are there any problems with 9.30am -> 5pm?

Slide 13

I say rules but as a request and favour to me and your colleagues, please don't keep checking emails/websites or try and do work whilst here, and I would ask you not to go back to the office at lunch. This will distract you from learning, and if you aren't on the back row, will probably distract those behind you. I said I will encourage you to run the scripts as I present, but you should just be typing against the shell. If you must do some work, I'd much rather you informed me that you need to leave the session, and go back to your office. I can't promise that I'll have time to bring you back up to speed, but you will be doing all your colleagues a favour.
