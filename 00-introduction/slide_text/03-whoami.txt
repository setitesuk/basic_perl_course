Who Am I?
SLide 14
So, Who Am I. I'm Andy Brown. I've been dabbling with perl since 2002, and have been programming full time since 2007.

I started at The Sanger Institute back in 1999 as a Finisher, and whilst in the department, self taught and went on courses like this to learn perl. Coming back from those courses, I wrote web applications and command line scripts to help in the department, including helping to rewrite gapNav, and writing the comptags script.

In 2007 I joined the NPG team, working on tracking applications for the New Sequencing Technologies, and my most recent/current project responsibility was redeveloping the primary and secondary analysis pipelines so that we could easily add or take away components.

I have dabbled in Ruby on Rails, and web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, XML).

One key thing I'd like to tell you though is that I have no 'formal' training in software development. All of it has been in house. My degree is in Chemistry and Business Studies, and I have a PGCE in Secondary Science with Chemistry (so you are being taught by a qualified teacher!)

When introducing yourself, I'd like you to say
