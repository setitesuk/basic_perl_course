### What if a test fails

If a test fails, prove and Test::More combine to inform us.

use Test::More tests => 1;

is( 'true', 'false', 'We expect this to fail' );

We know that true and false are different, so we have made this test fail. Lets see it

prove -v t/fail.t

1..1
not ok 1 - We expect this to fail

#   Failed test 'We expect this to fail'
#   at t/fail.t line 3.
#          got: 'true'
#     expected: 'false'
# Looks like you failed 1 test of 1.
Dubious, test returned 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)
Failed 1/1 subtests 

Test Summary Report
-------------------
t/fail.t (Wstat: 256 Tests: 1 Failed: 1)
  Failed test:  1
  Non-zero exit status: 1
Files=1, Tests=1,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.02 usr  0.00 sys +  0.02 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.04 CPU)

Obviously, in this case, we know this was to fail, but if you know what part of the code you are testing, it can help you locate what went wrong.
