One Liners

No introductory perl course would be complete without an introduction to perl one-liners. 

Now, depending on how you look at it, these are the most useful things possible, or the worst idea ever imagined.

Perl one-liners are exactly what they say on the tin. A perl script, in one line, on the command line.

Just try typing the following on the command line:

/software/perl -le 'print q{Hello World}'

Lets look at it

/software/perl

The first argument of any command line is the executable you want to run. In this case, we'll run the perl interpreter.

-le

This is actually two options

-l => all print statements should automatically have a newline appended to them

-e => tells the perl executable to treat the compile and and execute the next item (within quotes)

'print q{Hello World}'

The perl 'script' we want to compile and execute, in this case the statement print q{Hello World}
Note: We must use the q{} form of quoting, as the next ' will close the execute statement

When we run it, we get the output

Hello World
