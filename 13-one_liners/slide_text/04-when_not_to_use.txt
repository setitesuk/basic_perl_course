When not to use

Because you have the full power of perl, it can be tempting to just write a one-liner to solve a problem.

I mean, after all, you are only going to want to solve this once, or if you just want to see if something is stuck, then surely it's not necessary to write a script.

Wrong!

If you are writing more than 3 statements in a one-liner, think about why you are writing this.

If you are writing the one-liner to tell you something about a pipeline you are running, don't you think you'll want to run it tomorrow, or next week?

If you expect to run it more than once, you should think about writing a script:
1) You only need to call the script name, even if you do put it in pipes
2) you can write some tests for it
3) Someone will ask you for it - isn't it easier to give them a script name to call, rather than a email client formatted 300 character one-liner
4) It will become part of a project (even if you try to keep it separate)
5) You can start to refactor and capture the code - maybe it should be available in a module for others to use
