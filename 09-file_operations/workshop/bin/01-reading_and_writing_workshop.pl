# using the file 07-file_operations/data/1234_1_qseq.txt write a script
# that will obtain the sequence and the quality scores, generate a unique
# name for each read from other information, and then output out in the format

# read_name
# sequence
# quality

# into another file in the output directory

# note to remember, file paths are relative to where you run from

# for bonus points, try rewriting to use both methods for open/reading/writing
