Andy liked playing on his games console and watching telly. He was a slob, or couch potato.

One day a wizard called Grandalf came and sent Andy on a quest, in order to try get get him
to have a social life and meet some people. Andy started playing wargames, and his character
slew a dragon, took all its wealth and went home to live out a long life.

Andy still likes playing on his games console, but now he has a few more friends to play
against online. If only Grandalf has bought him a DNA sequencing machine instead, and set
him a quest to sequence the Slobbit genome, then perhaps he might have become famous.
