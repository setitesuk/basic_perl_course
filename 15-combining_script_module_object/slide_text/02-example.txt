Example: Producing a cup of tea

Script: make_tea

This is a process. So we want the script to go from start to end

1) get kettle
2) fill kettle with water
3) boil water
4) get cup
5) get teabag
6) put teabag in cup
7) add boiling water to cup
8) allow to brew
9) remove teabag from cup
10) add sugar
11) add milk
12) add lemon
13) drink

This is what it needs to do.

Modules:

Are there any processes which are repeated, and could be put into a module

adding something to something else?

Objects:

We have those

Kettle
Cup
Teabag

What do each of them have/do

Kettle - needs to be able to be filled with water, needs to boil water, needs to be able to be poured
Cup - needs to be able to have a teabag, water, milk, sugar, lemon, needs to be able to remove a teabag, needs to be drunk
Teabag - can be fresh/spent

So we can see options to utilise all three, although in practice with this, we probably wouldn't write a module just to provide hold the adding function, unless we could see benefits outside of making a cuppa.
